# Progress: SVG to PNG Converter - Initial Setup Phase

## 1. What Works

- Initial project setup completed as per `svg2png-setup.md`.
- Basic script functionality verified via manual test (`npm start -- ...`).
- Jest testing framework installed and configured (`jest.config.js`, `package.json` updated).
- Test suite (`tests/svg2png.test.ts`) created covering core features and sizing options.
- Test file moved into `tests/` directory and tests pass from new location.
- `README.md` created and updated with setup, usage, and feature documentation.
- Global installation via `npm link` implemented and tested.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) created and corrected for automated testing (includes build step).
- Build output configured to use `dist/` directory (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`).
- Local test execution (`npm test`) verified to run correctly against source files after `dist/` refactor and `jest.config.js` update.
- Generalized workflow documented in `docs/generalized-cli-tool-workflow.md`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Setup

- No further setup steps remaining based on current requests.

## 3. Current Status

- **[DONE]** Initial project setup and environment configuration.
- **[DONE]** Initial build verification (`npm run build` successful - prior to `dist/` refactor).
- **[DONE]** Basic script functionality testing (manual).
- **[DONE]** Test suite implementation (`tests/svg2png.test.ts`).
- **[DONE]** Test suite execution (`npm test` successful - prior to `dist/` refactor).
- **[DONE]** `README.md` creation and updates.
- **[DONE]** Global installation setup (`bin` field in `package.json` updated for `dist/`).
- **[DONE]** Global installation performed (`npm link` - prior to `dist/` refactor).
- **[DONE]** Global command tested successfully (`svg2png ...` - prior to `dist/` refactor).
- **[DONE]** GitHub Actions CI workflow created and corrected (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- **[DONE]** Configured project to use `dist/` directory for build output.
- **[DONE]** Re-built project to populate `dist/`.
- **[DONE]** Re-linked global command.
- **[DONE]** Tested re-linked global command successfully.
- **[DONE]** Corrected `jest.config.js` to ignore `dist/`.
- **[DONE]** Verified local tests (`npm test`) pass correctly after refactoring.
- **[DONE]** Created generalized workflow documentation (`docs/generalized-cli-tool-workflow.md`).

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- None at this stage. Potential issues might arise during `sharp` installation if native build tools are missing in the environment.
