# Active Context: SVG to PNG Converter - Initial Setup

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on the initial setup of the `svg2png` command-line tool project environment based on the specifications provided in `svg2png-setup.md`.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Initialized the Memory Bank core documentation files:
  - `projectBrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`

## 3. Next Steps

1. **[DONE]** Create the remaining core Memory Bank files (`progress.md`). (Note: `activeContext.md` was created earlier in the process).
2. **[DONE]** Create the `.clinerules` file with project operational standards.
3. **[DONE]** Execute the Node.js/TypeScript project initialization commands (`npm init`, `npm install`, `tsc --init`).
4. **[DONE]** Create the main application script file (`svg2png.ts`) with the provided source code.
5. **[DONE]** Update `package.json` to include the necessary `build` and `start` scripts.
6. **[DONE]** Verify the basic setup by attempting to build the project (`npm run build`).
7. **[DONE]** Test the script functionality with the provided sample SVG file (`assets/icon.svg`). Output generated at `output/icon.png`.
8. **[TODO]** Implement global installation steps (`npm link`) if desired by the user.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- Following the setup instructions precisely as laid out in `svg2png-setup.md`.
- Adhering to the operational standards defined in `.clinerules`.
- Build successful (`npm run build`).
- Build successful (`npm run build`).
- Basic test successful (`npm start -- --input assets/icon.svg --output output/icon.png`).
- Setup complete based on `svg2png-setup.md`.
