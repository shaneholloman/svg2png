# Active Context: SVG to PNG Converter - Initial Setup

## 1. Current Focus

Verifying local test execution and CI workflow configuration after refactoring to use `dist/` directory.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Completed initial project setup, testing, documentation, global linking, and CI workflow setup.
- Refactored project to use `dist/` for build output (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `README.md` updated).
- Rebuilt project, re-linked global command, and verified functionality.
- Updated `jest.config.js` to ignore `/dist/` path.
- Confirmed local tests (`npm test`) run correctly against source files only and pass.

## 3. Next Steps

- All requested setup, refactoring, testing, and CI configuration steps are complete.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- Refactored build output to `dist/`.
- Updated all relevant configuration files.
- Rebuilt project, re-linked global command, and verified functionality.
- Corrected `jest.config.js` to prevent tests running against compiled output.
- Verified local tests pass correctly after refactoring.
- Confirmed existing CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is suitable for the refactored structure (includes build step before test).
