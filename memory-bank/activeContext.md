# Active Context: SVG to PNG Converter - Initial Setup

## 1. Current Focus

Analyzing and documenting the technical considerations for integrating the `svg2png` tool (using `sharp`) into the `markdown-moose` VSCode extension.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Completed all setup, testing, refactoring, documentation (`README.md`), global linking, and CI workflow steps for the `svg2png` tool.
- Created `docs/generalized-cli-tool-workflow.md` documenting the development process.
- Analyzed `_codemaps/markdown-moose_codemap.md`.
- Created `docs/sharp-integration-technical-brief.md` summarizing the challenges (native dependencies, packaging, bundling) of integrating `sharp` into a VSCode extension.

## 3. Next Steps

- Discuss potential alternatives to `sharp` for SVG-to-PNG conversion within the VSCode extension context.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- Successfully completed all steps for the standalone `svg2png` tool.
- Documented the generalized development workflow.
- Identified native dependency packaging (`sharp`) as the primary challenge for `markdown-moose` integration.
- Documented the integration challenges and potential approaches in the technical brief.
